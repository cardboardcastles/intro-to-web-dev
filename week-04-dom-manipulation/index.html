    <p> This is the story of <b>You</b>. </p>
<p>Your name is INPUT1. </p>

<p> You, OUTPUT1, clicked on this website.</p>

<p> And now you're INPUT2 -ing this text. </p>
<p> ...really? The verb you chose was OUTPUT2 ?? How mature. <i>Anyway,</i></p>

<p>You/Name felt INPUT3 to know that this project was completed on time(ish). </p> 
<p> I feel OUTPUT3 about it too! Glad we're on the same page. 

<p> With all this typing, you started to feel hungry. You remembered you had a(n) INPUT4 in the fridge. </p>

<p>You took a break from reading this page to grab it. You felt much better after consuming a nice, cold OUTPUT4. You ate/drank the whole thing!</p>

<p>Finally, you reached the end of the input boxes. You decided the last one should say INPUT5.</p>

  What I bet you didn't expect, is that these silly things you've been typing tell another story. The result is below, enjoy the consequences of your actions: 

One day OUTPUT1 woke up with a start. They jumped out of bed and exclaimed, "Today is a great day to go out and OUTPUT2!!"

So, OUTPUT1 went about their business, engrossing themselves in the task. Their work was hard, but by the end of the day they felt OUTPUT3 about all they had done.
